# Description
Welcome to my seminar preparation resources! This website hosts a collection of short courses covering various topics that will help you prepare for your seminar thesis. If you are interested in large language models, or geographical data analysis, these materials are designed to you. Each course is self-contained and provides you with the fundamental knowledge and practical skills needed for your research project.

# Learning Outcomes
My goal is to introduce you to some basics and tools that will help you in your seminar thesis. 

Upon completing the sections, you will...

- know how to work with geographical data and GIS tools
- understand how to interact with and utilize large language models

Please note that these topics are **specifically designed for beginners**. No prior programming experience is required although it is helpful. The format accommodates different skill levels to ensure everyone can follow along and learn effectively.

# Blocks
The content of the course is currently organized in three blocks:

1. **Part I**: Geographical Data Analysis
2. **Part II**: Large Language Models

# Structure
The resources are mostly available on this website and some are also available as interactive Jupyter notebooks, which you can download and run locally on your computer. I will try to update the website as often as possible, to extend the content and reflect the latest developments in the field.

# How to see the slides
