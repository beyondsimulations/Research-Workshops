# Description
Welcome to this collection of resources! This website hosts a collection of information and resources that will help you prepare for your research. If you are interested in large language models, these materials are designed for you. The material is self-contained and provides you with the fundamental knowledge and practical skills needed for your research project.

The resources are mostly available on this website with links to some other resources. I will try to update the website in the future, to extend the content and reflect the latest developments in the field.
